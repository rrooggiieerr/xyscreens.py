## Introduction

This python library lets you control XY Screens projector screens and lifts over the RS-485
interface.

XY Screens is an OEM manufacturer of projector screens and lifts, their devices are sold around the
world under various brand names.

## Features

* Calculates screen position
* Synchronous and asynchronous methods
* Uses Callbacks for asynchronous methods

## Hardware

I use a cheap USB RS-485 controller to talk to the projector screen where position 5 of the RJ25
connector is connected to D+ and position 6 to the D-.

See the documentation of your specific device on how to wire yours correctly.

## Protocol

If your devices follows the following protocol it's supported by this Python library:

2400 baud 8N1  
Up command  : 0xFF 0xAA 0xEE 0xEE 0xDD  
Down command: 0xFF 0xAA 0xEE 0xEE 0xEE  
Stop command: 0xFF 0xAA 0xEE 0xEE 0xCC

## Supported projector screens and lifts

The following projector screens is known to work:

* iVisions Electro M Series

The following projector screens and lifts are not tested but use the same protocol according to the
documentation:

* iVisions Electro L/XL/Pro/HD Series
* iVisions PL Series projector lift
* Elite Screens
* KIMEX
* DELUXX

Please let me know if your projector screen or projector lift works with this Python library so I
can improve the overview of supported projector screens and lifts.

## Installation

You can install the Python XY Screens library using the Python package manager PIP:

`pip3 install xyscreens`

## `xyscreens` CLI

You can use the Python XY Screens library directly from the command line to move your screen up or
down or to stop the screen using the following syntax:

Move the screen down: `python3 -m xyscreens <serial port> <duration> down`  
Stop the screen: `python3 -m xyscreens <serial port> <duration> stop`  
Move the screen up: `python3 -m xyscreens <serial port> <duration> up`

Where `<duration>` is the time in seconds to move the screen up or down. The process will wait till
the screen is up or down and show the progress.

### Troubleshooting

You can add the `--debug` flag to any CLI command to get a more details on what's going on. Like so:

`python3 -m xyscreens <serial port> <duration> down --debug`
